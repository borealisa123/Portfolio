### Gee-nomics
- Built a class that implemented a Trie-based multi-map
- Worked with files that contained ~3 million bases (e.g. Ferroglobus_placidus's genome), storing the information in tries
- Searched the tries and found exact matches and SNiPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms, i.e. an exact match excluding one base) of short DNA sequences

### MNIST
- Played around with different machine learning models for the MNIST database
- Used the examples from "Deep Learning with Python" and experimented with changing the number of layers and parameters

### Zombie Dash
- Built the backend of a game called Zombie Dash by writing classes using polymorphism and managing the interaction between objects
- One example is determining object overlap vs object intersect. The first uses Euclidean distance between the center of two objects and the second uses a bounding box surrounding the objects
