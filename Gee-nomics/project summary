Built a Trie class that implemented a templated, Triebased multi-map
Worked with files that contained ~3 million bases (e.g. Ferroglobus_placidus's genome), storing the information in tries
Searched the trie found exact matches or SNiPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms, i.e. an exact match excluding one base) of short DNA sequences
